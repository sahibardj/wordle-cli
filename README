================================

golang implementation of wordle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle> in
command-line.

Build and play
==============
Assuming you have golang compiler, run the following commands:

$ git clone http://git.hanabi.in/repos/wordle-cli.git
$ cd wordle-cli
$ make # or, `go build -o wordle src/main.go`
$ ./wordle

I have moved the binary to /usr/local/bin so I can play directly -- depending on
your $PATH, consider moving the binary there.
Alternatively, run `make install`.

Caveats
=======

This game makes use of English words.
Consider editing the src/data/words.go -- and add a sorted list of words in the
language you want to port this game to.

While golang code can be compiled on UNIX-like OS (GNU/Linux and macos), as well
is windows, this game makes use of ANSI-colour codes to print colours in the
terminal.
ANSI colour-codes *might* not work on Windows, and without the colours, it could
be impossible to play this game.  (And now that I think of, if one is
colour-blind, they too might have a hard time playing this game.  Sorry!)

Source code
===========
The source code uses git for version control.

Get the source code by running:
$ git clone http://git.hanabi.in/repos/wordle-cli.git

The source code has three branches dev, prod and master.
+ dev: new features are added committed to dev.
+ prod: branch refers to the code ready to be used for production.
+ master -- git.hanabi.in makes use of stagit
  <https://codemadness.org/stagit.html>.  Stagit requires a master branch to
  generate web-front-end, and hence, the branch exists.

Additionally, the source code also has few tags.
+ One tag is called sahiba (the one who came up with the algo to get the clours)
-- tag named as a tribute for helping me with the game.
+ Other tags being semantic versioning (semver) of the software release.

I don't plan to add support for words of other languages -- however, replace the
array in src/data/words.go -- and add a sorted list of words of the language you
wish to support/play.

Please email patches to <me+git@hanabi.in>.

Authors

+ acagastya (Implementation of the stuff -- which anyone can do.)
+ sahiba (Designed the algo to get the colour code in O(n) -- the heart of this
  game -- yet she thinks she did nothing -- much better than my shitty algo
  which took like O(mn) and still didn't work -- thanks for that sexy algo,
  Â¡muchas gracias, amiga!)
+ murtaza (Helped with debugging the colour-keyboard bug!  Somehow, even
  without looking at the source code even once, he knew where the error was
  located!)

`git blame` should suffice (except for murtaz's help.)
